\par 
\par I. Overview
\par -----------
\par M.U.G.E.N is designed to be a 2D fighting game engine that lets you create your own characters and stages. Oriented more towards flexibility, making characters with M.U.G.E.N may initially seem a daunting task, but once you understand the basics, learning the rest of the tricks should come naturally.
\par 
\par M.U.G.E.N runs in DOS, and should work fine in a DOS box under Windows.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par II. The Files
\par -------------
\par A quick note: Here, we will use slashes (/) interchangeably with backslashes (\\) when referring to paths and filenames. For example, "DATA/MUGEN.CFG" would be considered equivalent to "DATA\\MUGEN.CFG". 
\par 
\par To begin, let us introduce the file types (denoted by their extension.)
\par AIR - Animation file; tells the program how to play back a sequence of
\par       sprites to form an animation.
\par CFG - Configuration file (see mugen.cfg in the following paragraph)
\par CNS - Character behavior file; defines how a character acts and moves
\par DEF - Definition file; has various purposes
\par SFF - Sprite file; contains one or more sprites
\par SND - Sound file; contains one or more sounds
\par 
\par 
\par (a) Files needed to run
\par 
\par There are several files you will need to run M.U.G.E.N. Here is a list of important files you will find in the program-only distribution, and what they do.
\par 
\par mugen.exe       The executable file
\par data/
\par   common1.cns   Contains behavior information common to all characters
\par   fight.def     Defines the way the "fight screen" looks
\par   mugen.cfg     Configuration file - preferences and settings
\par   select.cfg    Defines what characters are to included in the game
\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {\f6 graphics/
\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {\f6   fight.sff     Sprite file for "fight screen" graphics
\par   staticfx.air  Animation file for hit sparks, dust, and other effects
\par   staticfx.sff  The sprite file for staticfx.air
\par sound/
\par   fight.snd     Sound effects used in the "fight screen"
\par 
\par 
\par (b) Files needed for a character
\par 
\par All files for a certain character should be placed in its own directory under the chars/ directory. For example, if you have a character named "fighter", it will go into the directory "chars/fighter/".
\par 
\par Within each character's directory, you should have the following files. As an example, we will use the name "fighter". Substitute the name of your character for "fighter".
\par 
\par Required:
\par   fighter.air   Animation file for the character
\par   fighter.cmd   Tells how you start a "move"
\par   fighter.cns   1. Important data, such as speeds and sizes
\par                 2. Defines how the character executes moves
\par   fighter.def   Short file that has a list of filenames
\par   fighter.sff   Sprite file
\par   fighter.snd   Sound file
\par Optional:
\par   fighter1.act  Palette file (you can have up to 6)
\par   ...
\par   fighter6.act
\par 
\par See the document on creating characters for more details.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par III. Running the game
\par ---------------------
\par Assuming you have all the files ready, just type MUGEN at the DOS Prompt to begin.
\par 
\par Support may be added later for multiple game configurations.
\par 
\par First of all, here is the default key configuration.
\par 
\par Button      Player 1      Player 2
\par ------      --------      --------
\par   Up        Up arrow      Numpad Up
\par  Down       Down arrow    Numpad Down
\par  Left       Left arrow    Numpad Left
\par Right       Right arrow   Numpad Right
\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {\f6   X         L             Numlock 
\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {\f6   Y         semicolon     Numpad slash
\par   Z         double-quote  Numpad asterisk
\par   A         comma         Numpad -
\par   B         period        Numpad +
\par   C         slash         Numpad Enter
\par 
\par 
\par (a) The Main Menu
\par Choose from the following selections. To make a selection, press one of the keys corresponding to a button of a player. Pressing the Escape key will quit.
\par 
\par Arcade     Starts up a one-player mode where you fight all the 
\par            characters in random sequence.
\par Versus     Lets two players go against each other.
\par Watch      See the computer duke it out with another computer player.
\par Options    Set your preferences.
\par Exit       Quits M.U.G.E.N
\par 
\par For "arcade" mode, the key you hit will determine which side you play on. If you chose with one of Player One's keys, your character will play on the left side. If you chose with Player Two's keys, you will start on the right side.
\par 
\par In "watch" mode, first choose the one character to be on Player One's side, then choose a second to be his opponent.

\par To Write:
\par 1. steps for creating a BG
\par - sprites, recommended sizes, talk about scroll speed to size ratio
\par - use sprmaker to make it
\par - where to put
\par - how to make the def file
\par - colour 0 is transparent for "masked" sprites
