How Do I...?  A  M.U.G.E.N primer

Tutorial Part 1 
Updated 17 Aug 99

In this tutorial you will learn how to make a palette for your 
character, put together an input file for sprmaker and make an .sff 
with your sprites.  Also, you’ll see how to make an action by making 
a part of an .air file.  In Part 2 of the tutorial, you’ll be able to 
define bounding boxes for your sprites and define a simple attack 
within the .cns file.  For this tutorial, you’ll need sprmaker, 
airview, an imaging/paint program such as PhotoShop or PaintShop Pro.  
Also, you’ll need a text editor such as EDIT or Notepad and the 
player.zip, the template character files.

1. Making a palette
When converting sprites to 256 colors (also known as Indexed Color), 
Photoshop and PSP5 just makes the palette however it wants.  It's 
annoying to say the least.  With Photoshop, go to Image->Mode-
>Indexed Color.  A window will pop up.  In this window, set the 
palette to Exact.  Now, go to Image->Mode->Color Table and edit the 
bottom right color (that's color 0 in Photoshop) to be the bg color.  
Then take the old color 0 color and put it where the bg color used to 
be (swap the two colors essentially).  Save this palette (call it 
player.act for the purpose of this tutorial).  Do not save the .pcx.  
If all your pcxs are already in indexed color then you'll have to run 
pcxclean on them with the new palette.  If they are still in RGB 
mode, then when you convert to indexed color, choose custom for the 
pallete and load up the palette you just saved when it asks.

In PSP5, go to colors->decrease color depth->8bit (256).  Choose 
Optimized Octree and Nearest color for reduction method.  You might 
try to test some other options to see what works best.  Now, edit the 
palette (colors->edit palette) and swap the color in color 0 (upper 
left) with the your BG color.  Finally, save that palette and run it 
through pal2act.exe tool from Elecbyte’s page.  Now, run your sprites 
through pcxclean with your new palette.

2. How do I start making a character?
Go to the chars/ directory and make a new directory for your 
character. Let's call this character "Player", for an example 
(replace "player" with whatever you want to call your character). In 
this case, make a directory called chars/player.
Put the sprmaker and the other tools in the same directory as 
mugen.exe.

3. What does this character need?
You'll need to have these in the chars/player directory:
player.air
player.cmd
player.cns
player.def
player.sff
player.snd
player.act

In this tutorial, you’ll make player.sff.

4. How do I start making these files?
You can make them all from scratch... Or, you can download and copy 
over PLAYER from our website, and start from there.
Unzip PLAYER into the same directory as M.U.G.E.N, extracting with 
directories. That will create two directories:
  chars/player
  work/player
Also, you may want to get KFM from our website. He's a good 
reference.

5. OK, I got Player. Now what?

The first thing you want to do is make player.sff.  We’ll concentrate 
on just making standing and walking animations for now.  If you 
already have the sprites you want to use, get those ready.  Let’s say 
that the standing animations you want to use are named stand1.pcx – 
stand5.pcx and are in the work/player directory.  Now, make a text 
file inside work/player and call that file player.txt (of course you 
can name it anything you want).  Here’s the start of the text file…

;Options
#
;Palette

;Shared palette

;Don’t change the above options
;Filename:
;This is where sprmaker will make the file
chars\player\player.sff
;----------------
;your sprite file name
work\player\stand1.pcx   
;group number

;image number  You’ll use these numbers in the air file

;X and Y axis,  you’ll have to change these numbers

; end of file

Group number 0 is used for standing frames.  Check air.txt for 
recommended numbers for other actions.  The image number just 
specifies which image it is within a particular group number.  You 
have to get your own X and Y axis from your sprite.  For standing 
frames, it is usually at the very bottom in the middle of the sprite.
For jumping sprites, the axis is usually in the where the character’s 
feet would be if they were standing.  That usually is in the center 
below the sprite.  You can check KFM’s sprites by running MUGEN and 
pressing Ctrl-C while playing.  This will bring up the characters’ 
bounding boxes and axes.

Once you have player.txt ready, go to the directory where you put 
mugen.exe and sprmaker.exe, etc and make player.sff by typing:
sprmaker < work\player\player.txt
If you get errors or player.sff wasn’t made, check the text file for 
errors.

6. I made the .sff, now what?

Ok, now that player.sff is made, you can go to player.air file and 
add a standing animation action.

It’s time to make player.air.  Remember, the format for .air is
Group number, image number, X offset, Y offset, game-ticks, [options]
Don’t worry about the lines that start with Clsn2 and Clsn2Default 
for now.

; Standing Animation
[Begin Action 000]   ;Action 000 is the standing animation
Clsn2Default: 2
 Clsn2[0] = -10,  0, 10,-79
 Clsn2[1] =  -4,-92,  6,-79
0,3, 0,0, 7  
;The above line means to look in group 0 for image number 3 and 
;display it for 7 game-ticks.  1 game-tick is 1/60 of a sec, so 60 
;ticks is 1 second.  Group 0 Image 3 is stand4.pcx.
0,2, 0,0, 7
0,1, 0,0, 7
0,0, 0,0, 7
0,1, 0,0, 7
0,2, 0,0, 7
0,3, 0,0, 7
0,4, 0,0, 7
;end of file

Now, save this file and you’re ready to see how your character looks!

7. Checking out your actions
If all the files are in the right place, you can directly load your 
character with mugen by typing:
mugen player player

This is a shortcut for versus mode.

8. Continuing with Actions and Sprites

Now that you know the basics of making sprites and actions, you 
should continue by making the sprites from spr.txt and actions from 
the Reserved Action Numbers in air.txt.  

In part 2 of the tutorial, you’ll be able to define your character’s 
bounding boxes so they can get hit and hit other characters.  
Finally, we’ll show you how to define some attacks in the .cns.
