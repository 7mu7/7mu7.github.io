i recomend just doing a css parallax for the scrolling bg as it takes up less space with the same result other than that gg.

.parallax {
    background-image: url("images/bg.jpg");
    min-height: 800px;
    background-attachment: fixed;
    background-position: center;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
}
